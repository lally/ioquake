* Runtime Notes
  - SDL will _FAIL_ unless you unset LANG.
  - You can run this in *Xephyr*!!
    pfexec Xephyr :1.0 &
    xauth extract - $DISPLAY | DISPLAY=:1.0 xauth merge -
    DISPLAY=:1.0 ./ioquake3.i386

  - This works  *RELIABLY*

* Source Code Notes
** Key Routines
   
   | Name        | Location         | Purpose                 |
   |-------------+------------------+-------------------------|
   | main        | sys/sys_main.c   | main() of program       |
   | SV_Frame    | server/sv_main.c | Primary simulation loop |
   | SV_BotFrame | server/sv_bot.c  | Invoke Bot AI           |
   |             |                  |                         | 

  
* Simulation
** AI link-in to sv-main.
   - Maybe the easiest way is to just have my own routine feed in?
   - Some sort of configuration management is needed here.
     - Console variables! -- NO.  They have various
       archive/replication policies which could really mess things up.
     - qcommon/common.c has them there.  Track them and add more.
       | Variable        | Purpose                  | To-enable |
       |-----------------+--------------------------+-----------|
       | com_ls_runsim   | Run load simulator       |           |
       | com_ls_headless | Disable graphics display |           |
     - Setup a new file, header, and set of flag facilities.
